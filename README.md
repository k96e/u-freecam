## What's This

As the name suggests, this a freecam tool for games built on the Unity engine. 

It also comes with an in-game speed change feature.

## Download

Pre-built versions can be downloaded from the [Release](https://github.com/flpflan/u-freecam/releases) page.

If you want the latest development version, you can also download it from the [CI](https://github.com/flpflan/u-freecam/actions) build artifacts.

## Build

[docs/BUILD.md](/docs/BUILD.md)

## How to Use

### General Methods

By any means, load this dynamic library into the target process or application[^1]. 

For example, on Windows, you can use the DLL injection tool that comes with Cheat Engine (CE), while on Android, you can use [XInjector](https://github.com/WindySha/XInjector) (Non-root environments can use [Android-Virtual-Inject](https://github.com/reveny/Android-Virtual-Inject/releases/latest)).

### Loading via dwmapi.dll Proxy

This method only works on Windows. Copy the DLL to game directory and rename it to `dwmapi.dll`, then launch the game.

## Configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> u-freecam has three different operating modes, and their behavior can vary greatly depending on the game.\
> Depending on the game, some modes may not work correctly or may even cause the game to crash.
> You can try out all three modes and choose the one that works best for you.

After loaded to the process , a WebUI interface will be started on the local port __23333__. This interface can be accessed via a browser to adjust various program parameters.

To access it locally, simply open http://localhost:23333.

## Keybindings

> [!TIP]
> These keybindings are configurable through [WebUI](#Configuration).

> [!TIP]
> You can use an external keyboard on Android.

| Freecam        | Keybind                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Toggle Freecam | Enter                                      |
| Movement       | WASD, Ctrl, Space, and Shift_L (Sprint)    |
| Rotation       | Mouse / Arrow keys / Touch screen (Moblie) |
| UI Mode        | Mouse middle button / U                    |
| Zoom           | Hold Z + Mouse Wheel / X or C              |
| Roll Camera    | Q/E                                        |
| Reset Camera   | R                                          |

> Initially, the Anchor coincides with the Camera.\
> In all cases, the Camera moves with and rotates around the Anchor.\
> With the Anchor fixed, the relative position between Camera and Anchor can be changed through movement.\
> Attach Mode sets the target object as Anchor. (By default, the object corresponding to the center of the screen is selected as the target.)

| Anchor             | Keybind     |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Pin Anchor         | Hold M      |
| Reset to Anchor    | Shift_L + M |
| Toggle Attach Mode | T           |

| Speed Hack                  | Keybind   |
| --------------------------- | -         |
| Speed up                    | +         |
| Speed down                  | -         |
| Freeze speed / Resume speed | Backspace |

| SBS 3D                         | Keybind                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Toggle SBS 3D output           | B                               |
| Increase / Decrease separation | L / J (hold Shift_L for faster) |
| Push / Pull convergence        | I / K (hold Shift_L for faster) |

## SBS 3D Output

While the freecam is on, its view can be output as side-by-side stereo for 3D TVs, AR/VR glasses, or free viewing. The parameters live under "自由镜头 (FreeCam) → SBS 3D" in the WebUI:

- **Format**: `HalfSBS` squeezes each eye into half the width for the display to stretch back, which suits most 3D TVs and glasses. `FullSBS` keeps each eye's aspect ratio, for parallel/cross-eyed free viewing or displays running the game at double width (e.g. 3840×1080).
- **Separation**: Distance between the eyes, in game world units. World scale differs between games, so the default of 0.064 may need tuning.
- **Convergence**: Objects at this distance sit on the screen plane; nearer ones pop out and farther ones recede.
- **Swap eyes**: Swaps the left and right images, for cross-eyed viewing.

> [!NOTE]
> Stereo output renders the scene twice, so expect a higher performance cost.\
> Game UI drawn as Screen Space - Overlay is not split per eye, and neither is anything the game draws with its other cameras (UI, effects).

## FAQ

### The game crashes on the first attempt

This is normal; please try again. If it still doesn't work, please submit an issue.

### Access to the WebUI is available, but function keys are unresponsive

Try changing the loop mode to `Mock`. This mode reduces key sensitivity but provides better compatibility.

[^1]:For some modified/hardened engines, this need to be injected at the time of game startup.
